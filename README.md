Hyder Properties Real-Estate Mobile App

Description:
- A capstone project as part of my BSC at Eduvos, I was involved in a development team of students which built a database-driven mobile application for a local registered business, Hyder Properties. App users could view property listings, navigate to property showings, and chat to an agent via a messaging add-on feature. Property listings and user account information were stored through Googleâ€™s FireStore API.

What I Learned:
- Seemingly simple mobile apps can be complex integrated systems.
- Research and commit to a development methodology. Installed and configured tools such as Android Studio and Expo. 
- Experience the difficulties of cross-platform development.
- Utilisation of native device-dependant features.
